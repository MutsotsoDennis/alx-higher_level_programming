Python provides a versatile and straightforward approach to Input/Output operations, making it user-friendly and efficient for handling data. Input can be obtained from the user through the 'input()' function, allowing interactive communication with the program. On the other hand, the 'print()' function facilitates easy output to the console. Python's 'open()' function is instrumental in working with files, offering various modes such as read ('r'), write ('w'), and append ('a'). This flexibility extends to handling different file formats, including text, CSV, and JSON. Python's 'input()' and 'print()' functions can handle a variety of data types, and the language supports formatted string literals (f-strings) for concise and expressive output. With its user-friendly syntax and powerful capabilities, Python simplifies Input/Output operations, contributing to its widespread use in diverse application domains.
